# Data.csv Feature Explanation

This dataset contains weather data recorded over time. Each feature is described below, along with the intended analysis goals.

## Features

- **name**: The name of the location where the data was recorded (e.g., city name).
- **datetime**: The date and time when the data was recorded.
- **tempmax**: The maximum temperature recorded on that day.
- **tempmin**: The minimum temperature recorded on that day.
- **temp**: The average temperature recorded on that day.
- **feelslikemax**: The maximum "feels like" temperature, which is a measure of how hot or cold it feels.
- **feelslikemin**: The minimum "feels like" temperature.
- **feelslike**: The average "feels like" temperature.
- **dew**: The dew point temperature, which indicates the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture.
- **humidity**: The percentage of humidity in the air.
- **precip**: The amount of precipitation (rainfall) recorded.
- **precipprob**: The probability of precipitation occurring.
- **precipcover**: The percentage of the area that experienced precipitation.
- **preciptype**: The type of precipitation (e.g., rain, snow).
- **snow**: The amount of snowfall recorded.
- **snowdepth**: The depth of snow accumulation.
- **windgust**: The maximum speed of wind gusts recorded.
- **windspeed**: The average wind speed recorded.
- **winddir**: The direction of the wind, measured in degrees.
- **sealevelpressure**: The atmospheric pressure at sea level.
- **cloudcover**: The percentage of the sky covered by clouds.
- **visibility**: The distance at which objects can be clearly seen.
- **solarradiation**: The amount of solar radiation received, measured in W/m².
- **solarenergy**: The amount of solar energy received, measured in MJ/m².
- **uvindex**: The level of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
- **severerisk**: The risk level for severe weather events.
- **sunrise**: The time of sunrise.
- **sunset**: The time of sunset.
- **moonphase**: The phase of the moon, indicating how full or new the moon is.
- **conditions**: A brief description of the weather conditions (e.g., clear, rainy).

- **icon**: A weather icon representing the condition.
- **stations**: The identifiers of the weather stations that recorded the data.

## Analysis Goals

The following aspects of the data are intended for analysis:

- **Temperature**: Predicting the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures.
- **Humidity**: Predicting the level of humidity.
- **Precipitation**: Predicting the amount of rainfall.
- **Wind**: Predicting the wind speed and direction.
- **Cloud Cover**: Predicting the percentage of cloud cover.
- **Visibility**: Predicting the visibility distance.
- **UV Index**: Predicting the UV index level.

This dataset is designed to be used for weather prediction analysis, focusing on the time period from August 21, 2024, to December 31, 2024.
